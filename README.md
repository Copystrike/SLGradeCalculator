### `SLGRADECALCULATOR`

---

So basically I need to pass this year, and to know if will pass this year I need to keep track of my scores on my test and homework to see if I preform enough to get thru school... Thing is this school system called "smartschool" isnt that smart after all as it first of all is made in PHP lmfao and second it doesnt display the end total so since I cannot be bored to mail them etc I gonna just do it my self by creating an browser extension!
